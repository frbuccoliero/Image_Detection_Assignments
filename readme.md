# Mathematical models and methods for Image Processing

Here are the assignments I worked on for the course "Mathematical models and methods for Image Processing" held by Prof. Giacomo Boracchi at Politecnico di Milano during the A.Y. 2023-2024.

### Gradient Descent and Optimization

- Gradient Descent (lez12_gradient_descent)
- ISTA (lez13_ISTA)
- FISTA (lez14_FISTA)

### Dictionary Learning and Sparse Representations

- DCT Images (Lez2_DCT_Images)
- Sliding DCT (Lez3_SlidingDCT)
- Matching Pursuit (lez6_matching_pursuit)
- OMP (lez7_OMP)
- KSVD (lez10_KSVD)
- OMP Denoising (lez9_OMPdenoising)
- Limitations of Sparsity (Lez4_limitations_of_sparsity)

### Image Denoising and Inpainting
